# trainer-telegram
A ready-to-use telegram bot made with python. The bot send you every day (each 24h later you start the script) the training you scheduled in a .csv file like the example one.
This is just a test for the parsing algorithm: I'm going to add many features like: scheduled time; .csv file generator; [...].
Need to start the script on monday.
